Try to understood SOLID principles

What is wanted here is something like the following substitution property: 
if for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that, 
for all programs P deÔ¨Åned in terms of T, 

the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.
